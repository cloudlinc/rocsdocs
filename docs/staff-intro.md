# ROCS Staff Guide

Welcome to Rocket Online Schools (ROCS)! This guide will help you assist families and students in getting started and ensure a smooth beginning to their online learning journey.

## What Students Will Need

Ensure that each student is set up with the following essentials:

- A Chromebook provided by ROCS, or a Mac/Windows computer.
- Access to the Acellus online curriculum platform (login details provided by the teacher).
- A reliable internet connection.
- A dedicated space where the student can focus on their studies.

## Assisting with Chromebook Setup

When helping students set up their Chromebook, follow these steps:

1. Guide the family in powering on the Chromebook by pressing the power button.
2. Assist them in connecting to Wi-Fi by selecting the appropriate network and entering the password.
3. Provide the login credentials assigned to the student and help them log in.
4. Ensure that the Acellus platform is visible on the home screen, where coursework and lessons will be accessible.

## Accessing the Acellus Platform

Acellus is the platform students use for their classes, assignments, and progress tracking. When assisting students:

1. Instruct them to open the Acellus app on their Chromebook or visit the website on their computer.
2. Ensure they use the correct username and password to log in.
3. Encourage them to explore their courses and get familiar with the platform's layout.

If students experience any login or access issues, direct them to contact support@rocs.org for assistance, or submit a support ticket on their behalf.

## Providing Help and Support

As support staff or teachers, you may encounter different types of issues. Here's how to address them:

- **Technical Issues**: For Chromebook malfunctions, Acellus login problems, or coursework access issues, ensure the family contacts support@rocs.org or submit a ticket. Follow up as necessary to provide timely support.
- **Academic Support**: Be responsive to student questions about their courses or assignments through email or the Acellus messaging system.
