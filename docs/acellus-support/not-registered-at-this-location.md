# You Have Not Registered at This Location

### Problem

When trying to log in to Acellus, you receive the error message: "**You have not registered at this location**," preventing access to your account.

### Solution

This issue often occurs when your Acellus account is still active on another device, causing a conflict with the new login attempt. To resolve this, follow these steps:

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Identify Other Devices:**
   - Think about any other computers or devices where you might have logged into Acellus.

2. **Close Acellus on Other Devices:**
   - Go to the other device(s) and close the Acellus application or browser tab where it's running.
   - Ensure the session is completely ended by logging out if possible.

3. **Refresh Your Current Acellus Page:**
   - On the device where you're experiencing the issue, refresh the Acellus login page.
   - You can do this by clicking the refresh icon or pressing `F5` on your keyboard.

4. **Attempt to Log In Again:**
   - Enter your login credentials on the refreshed page.
   - You should now be able to access your account without the error message.

### Additional Tips

- **Avoid Simultaneous Logins:** To prevent this issue in the future, always log out of Acellus on one device before logging in on another.
- **Clear Browser Cache:** If the problem persists, try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, then attempt to log in again.
- **Wait It Out:** If you're unable to close the session on the other device, wait for about 15 minutes for the session to time out automatically.
