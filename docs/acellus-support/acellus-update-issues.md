# Acellus Update Issues

### Problem:
Student sees a message like "Can you walk me through how to do an update for Chrome and Acellus please? It is saying an update is required but not giving me the option to launch it. I've checked all settings and there's nowhere for an update for Chrome and Acellus."

### Solution:
#### Check for Chrome OS Updates:
1. Have the family/student go into Chromebook settings and check for updates.
2. Click the time at the bottom right, select the gear icon to open settings.
3. Click "About Chrome OS" and then "Check for updates."

#### If Update Doesn't Resolve the Issue:
##### Perform a Powerwash (Factory Reset):
If the update doesn't resolve the issue:
1. Sign out of the Chromebook.
2. Press and hold Ctrl + Alt + Shift + r.
3. Select Restart.
4. In the box that appears, select Powerwash > Continue.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in with the Google Account and complete the setup process.

#### If Issue Persists After Powerwash:
The Shipping/Support Team should send a replacement Chromebook.

### Tips:
- Ensure the Chromebook is connected to a stable internet connection before attempting updates.
- Remind users to save any important data before performing a Powerwash, as it will erase all local data.
