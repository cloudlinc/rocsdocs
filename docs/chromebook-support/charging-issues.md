# Charging Issues

### Problem:
Chromebook is not charging, or the charger appears to be faulty.

### Solution:
#### Basic Troubleshooting:
Ask the student or parent to try a different charger, if available, to determine if the issue lies with the charger or the Chromebook itself.
Suggest checking if the charging port on the Chromebook is clean and free of debris.

#### If the Charger is Faulty:
Confirm that the charger is the issue.
Direct the student or parent to email support@rocs.org to put in a ticket for a replacement charger.
Support/shipping will mail a replacement charger once the ticket is received.

#### If the Chromebook is Faulty:
Confirm the Chromebook is not charging with a known working charger.
Direct the student or parent to email support@rocs.org to put in a ticket for a replacement Chromebook.
Arrange for a replacement Chromebook to be sent once the ticket is received.
Provide instructions for returning the faulty Chromebook if necessary.

#### Tips:
Quick Diagnosis: Suggest that the parent try charging the Chromebook with a different power outlet to rule out issues with the electrical source.
Replacement Process: Clearly communicate the expected timeline for receiving a replacement to manage expectations.
