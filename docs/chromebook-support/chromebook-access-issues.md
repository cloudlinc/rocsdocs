# Chromebook Access Issues

### Problem:
The Chromebook is locked with a password or the student cannot access specific links.

### Solution:
#### Hard Restart:
Instruct the student or parent to press and hold the power button to perform a hard restart. This often resolves minor issues without further steps.

#### Factory Reset (Powerwash):
If the hard restart does not resolve the issue:
1. Sign out of the Chromebook.
2. Press and hold Ctrl + Alt + Shift + r.
3. Select Restart.
4. In the box that appears, select Powerwash > Continue.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to sign in with the Google Account and complete the setup process.

#### Tips:
Access Links Issue: Ensure the Chromebook's OS is updated, as outdated systems might not access newer websites or resources properly.
