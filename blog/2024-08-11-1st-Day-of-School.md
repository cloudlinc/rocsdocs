Dear Parents,

As we approach the exciting start of a new school year, we want to remind you that our final orientation session is tomorrow, August 12th, with options to join at 8 AM, 12 PM, or 7 PM. These sessions are a fantastic way to get prepared and ensure you are all set for the first day of classes. Your advisor should have already sent you a Zoom link for the orientation. If you have not received this link, please contact our support team.

Missed an Orientation? No Worries! If your schedule prevented you from attending a previous session, or if you are unable to attend tomorrow, it's okay! Each orientation has been recorded, and a copy is available through your advisor. Simply contact support, or reach out directly to your advisor to receive a copy.

First Day of Class â€“ Tuesday, August 13th We are all excited to kick off the new academic year this Tuesday! Your advisors are in the process of sending out student email accounts along with instructions on how to log in and get started.

Haven't Received Your Login Info? If you have not yet received your login details or if you have any questions or need assistance logging in, please do not hesitate to contact our support team. Additionally, you can visit our Getting Started Guide at https://start.rocs.org/ for detailed instructions and helpful tips to log into your courses.

We want to ensure every family feels supported and informed. Please reach out at any time if there is anything you need or any questions you have. We are here to help and look forward to a fantastic start to the year!

Warm regards,
